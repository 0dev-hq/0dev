# 0DEV ðŸ¤–

**0dev** is, what we call, an **Insights & Assistant** platform powered by AI.

The `Insights` part of the platform allows users to easily connect to multiple data sources, execute queries, and generate reports. The `Assistant` part of the platform allows you to create general-purpose Agents you can delegate tasks to. You can empower your agents with access to data sources to not only answer questions but also take actions on your behalf.

The interface between you and the platform is mainly through a chat interface. You won't need any technical background to gain insights or to create the agents and interact with them.
