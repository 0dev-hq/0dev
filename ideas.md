Simplified Data Sharing with Permissions
Pain Point: Users need to share data with external stakeholders but struggle with controlling whatâ€™s accessible.
Feature: Allow users to generate sharable links to specific data sets or reports with view-only or time-limited access. Users can choose specific data points or sections to share, making it easier to provide stakeholders with the right information while keeping sensitive data secure.
