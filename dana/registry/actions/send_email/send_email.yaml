  The `send_email` action provides a robust utility for sending emails programmatically using 
  an SMTP server. It supports sending plain text or HTML-formatted emails to a single recipient. 
  This action is ideal for scenarios requiring automated email notifications, alerts, or customized 
  email workflows. Key considerations:
  
  1. **Email Format**: Supports both plain text and HTML email content for the `body` input. HTML 
     allows embedding rich text, links, and images within the email.
  2. **Authentication**: Requires valid SMTP credentials (username and password) to authenticate 
     with the email server.
  3. **Encryption**: Ensures secure transmission using TLS or SSL protocols, depending on the SMTP 
     server's configuration.
  4. **Sender Customization**: Allows specifying a custom "From" email address, enabling flexible 
     sender identity.
  5. **Error Handling**: Provides detailed error messages in case of failure, making it easier to 
     debug issues like invalid credentials, unreachable servers, or recipient errors.
  6. **Limitations**: This action does not support sending attachments or multiple recipients. 
     Developers requiring these features should consider extending the action or using alternative 
     solutions.
  
  This action simplifies email integration within applications, allowing developers to configure 
  email operations with minimal effort.
